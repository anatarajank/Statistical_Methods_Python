# Statistical Methods for Decision Making

This repository contains three Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate the application of statistical methods for decision making in business scenarios. The notebooks utilizes three datasets: Wholesale Customers Data, CMSU Student Survey, and Shingles Data, to explore various statistical concepts and draw actionable insights.

## Project Overview

This project aims to showcase the power of statistical analysis in understanding data and making informed decisions. Through the use of descriptive statistics, data visualization, hypothesis testing, and probability calculations, the notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of the datasets and offers valuable business recommendations.

## Datasets

The notebook utilizes the following datasets:

1. **Wholesale Customers Data:** This dataset contains information about the spending habits of wholesale customers across different regions and channels. It includes variables such as fresh, milk, grocery, frozen, detergents_paper, and delicatessen purchases.

2. **CMSU Student Survey:** This dataset comprises responses from a survey conducted on undergraduate students at Clear Mountain State University (CMSU). It includes variables such as gender, major, graduation intention, employment status, computer ownership, GPA, salary expectations, spending habits, and text message frequency.

3. **Shingles Data:** This dataset contains measurements of moisture content in two types of asphalt shingles, A and B. It is used to analyze the quality of the shingles and ensure they meet the required standards.

## Analysis and Insights

The notebook conducts a thorough analysis of the datasets, covering the following aspects:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** This section involves data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and data visualization to gain initial insights into the datasets.

2. **Contingency Tables and Probability Calculations:** This section utilizes contingency tables and probability calculations to explore relationships between categorical variables and understand the likelihood of events.

3. **Hypothesis Testing:** This section employs hypothesis testing to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. For example, it tests whether the mean moisture content in shingles is within permissible limits and whether the population means for shingles A and B are equal.

4. **Business Recommendations:** Based on the analysis, the notebook provides actionable recommendations for businesses and stakeholders.
